== System installation ==

This library is header only. So you can either copy `include/cxxopts.hpp` to `/usr/include` or `/usr/local/include`, or add `include` to your search path.

== Building the examples and tests ==

It is preferable to build out of source. Make a build directory somewhere, and then
do the following, where `${CXXOPTS_DIR}` is the path that you checked out `cxxopts`
to:

  cmake ${CXXOPTS_DIR}
  make

You can use another build tool, such as ninja.

  cmake -G Ninja ${CXXOPTS_DIR}
  ninja


To run the tests, run `make test`.
